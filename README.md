Hey guys. This project is the certification of a learning series containing: Responsive web desing. Include: Box model, flexbox, typography, accessibility.
My inspiration came from Hedy, as she was a pioneer in laying the foundations for the future invention of wifi who despite having a turbulent personal life, having a background in something other than programming (acting) managed to focus her talent on creating the foundations of something wonderful that today benefits us all.
That's why I wanted to leave it in b&w to keep it in its time.

 Leave me a comment if you want to know more. Chau.
