        <ul>
            <li>During World War II, Lamarr and composer George Antheil devised a system to prevent military communications from being intercepted.</li>
            <li>The system, called "frequency hopping", was based on changing the frequency of the radio signal at random.</li>
            <li>Although the patent was granted in 1941, it was not adopted by the US military until the 1960s.</li>
            <li>Frequency hopping technology is the basis of modern wireless communications such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS.</li>
            <li>Despite her important contribution, Lamarr did not receive recognition for her invention until decades later.</li>
            <li>In 1997, the year before her death, she was awarded the Pioneer Award by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</li>
            <li>In 2014, Google honoured her with a Doodle on the 100th anniversary of her birth.</li>
            <li>Hedy Lamarr is an example of a pioneering woman who challenged the gender roles of her time.</li>
            <li>Her invention has had a significant impact on the development of wireless communications.</li>
            <li>Her story is an inspiration to women aspiring to careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.</li>
